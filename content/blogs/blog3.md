title: Is our planet getting hotter?

*Background:*
In this project, we study temperature anomalies relative to the base period of 1951-1980. We visualize the data and calculate a 95% confidence interval for the temperature deviation to determine whether global temperature rise is statistically significant. 


*Collaborators:* Ilana Kovalenko, Alex Vignjevic, Jasper Muller, Keshav Asokan, and Ziyi Yang
